### About Swift
Swift is [Apple's](http://www.apple.com/swift) newish programming langauges that finally substitutes Objective-C. It reminds me a lot of ruby. 

I like it because it is concise and elegant. It is a modern langague with many up-to-date features. After a few iterations in the first year, Swift 2.0 seems to be pretty much defined.
