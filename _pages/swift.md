### About Swift 

Swift is [Apple's newish programming language](http://www.apple.com/swift) that finally substitutes Objective-C. It reminds me a lot of ruby.

I like it because it is concise and elegant. It is a modern langague with many up-to-date features. After a few iterations in the first year, Swift 2.0 seems to be pretty much defined and very robust.

Main goodies are: 

- improved type safety, e.g. via optionals
- better memory management 
- increased speed
- functional paradigms
- multiple return values
- interoperability (for all those old Objective-C frameworks)
